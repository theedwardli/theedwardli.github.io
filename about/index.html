## about <br />
My name is Edward Li and I'm a sophomore at Brown University. I'm a computer science major whose interests lie primarily at the intersection of computer science, economics, and public policy. This site serves as my personal blog and as a gateway to projects that I've worked on. Feel free to check out my <a href="http://theedwardli.github.io/articles">articles</a>, take a peek at my <a href="http://theedwardli.github.io/resume">resume</a>, or <a href="mailto:Edward_Li@brown.edu">get in touch</a>. <br /> <br />

# notice <br />
This site is currently in beta. Please let me know if there's anything that isn't quite working the way that it should!
